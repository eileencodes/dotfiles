The Consequences of Not Understanding How ActiveRecord Translates into MySQL\n\nDescription\nThe magic of ActiveRecord database interactions is easy to rely on and allows us assume it knows best. Without a solid understanding of how ActiveRecord translates into MySQL, however, significant issues can arise. This is particularly true with large data sets and complex model relationships. My talk explores an example for each CRUD function and shows how these queries can result in MySQL timeouts, memory issues or stack level too deep errors. The examples will examine the consequences of chaining large datasets, uses for Arel, and how to avoid encountering major problems and most importantly, how these queries can be rewritten to run more efficiently.\n\n\nBio\n\nEileen M. Uchitelle is a Senior Developer for PhishMe, a leading provider of SaaS solutions that combat phishing attacks through targeted immersive training.

In her spare time she enjoys making ravioli from scratch, craft beer, and contributing to open source projects.\n\nJustification\n\nI've wanted to start giving talks for awhile but I didn't want to force the topic. Most importantly, I wanted something that all levels of ruby developers could benefit from. It's not often when building an application do we have large amounts of data to create, read, update, or destroy. I came across this issue in a few cases while working on PhishMe's application. Too often we let ActiveRecord do all the work for us without truly understanding how chaining (for example user.products) our query times. If the dataset is large enough it can result in timeouts or memory issues. Developers will benefit from this talk by learning from my mistakes so they don't have to hit these issues. Even with small queries it is better to code for performance rather than ActiveRecord magic.","markers":{"markers":{"1":{"id":1,"range":[[0,0],[0,0]],"tailed":false,"reversed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"never","persistent":true,"properties":{"type":"selection","editorId":14,"preserveFolds":true,"goalBufferRange":null},"deserializer":"Marker"},"4":{"id":4,"range":[[6,530],[6,534]],"tailed":true,"reversed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"inside","persistent":true,"properties":{"replicate":false},"deserializer":"Marker"},"5":{"id":5,"range":[[6,530],[6,534]],"tailed":true,"reversed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"inside","persistent":true,"properties":{"replicate":false},"deserializer":"Marker"}},"deserializer":"MarkerManager"},"history":{"undoStack":[],"redoStack":[],"deserializer":"History"},"filePath":"/Users/eileen/Documents/Eileen/Personal/Brand/Presentations/mtn_west_ruby_cfp_2014.txt","modifiedWhenLastPersisted":false,"digestWhenLastPersisted":"5e5c6858694c86fe03baee48689760e54fa98803","deserializer":"TextBuffer"},{"text":"Talk Title:\nCRUD!
